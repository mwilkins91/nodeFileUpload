//Pseudo Code
// Form submission hits route 
//folder is created (fs.mkdir($PATH)) yes
//files are uploaded
//Generate doc from content, save with uploads Spreadsheet? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17450412/how-to-create-an-excel-file-with-nodejs

//Then, send folder to drive
//IF SUCCESFULL delete server copy of folder



//Middleware Chain
    //makeFolders()   ---next()--->   renameAndMoveFiles()   ---next()--->   writeBodyTextToDocument()   ---next()--->  uploadToDrive()   ---next()--->  deletelocalFolder() **END**
        //1) makeFolders() --> Creates local folder and Google Folder, passes names and directory onto next function via req.folderInfo{}
        //2) renameAndMoveFiles() --> Files are uploaded to ./uploads, this function takes them and adds extension (.jpg, .mov, etc), then puts them in the local folder listed in req.folderInfo{}
        //3) writeBodyTextToDocument() --> Takes text posted by the form and writes it into a document (.txt? Excel? TBD...) then puts it into the local folder.
        //4) uploadToDrive() --> Takes the local folder listed in req.folderInfo and uploads it to the google folder listed in req.folderInfo
        //5) IF UPLOAD SUCCESSFULL, delete local folder. IF NOT, try again?
